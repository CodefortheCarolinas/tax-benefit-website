# 50 States for Tax Benefits
A website created by Code for the Carolinas for Get Child Tax Credit (GetCTC). Built to support Child Tax Credit (CTC) messaging campaign.

## Purpose
This website was created to support the Code for America tax benefits team as they prepared to launch a messaging campaign. Many families are eligible for the Child Tax Credit, but must file a tax return to receive it. The goal for GetCTC with this project is for state benefits agencies in all 50 states to perform outreach to families to let them know they may be elgible for CTC if the family files a return. This website provides sample messages that agencies may use for outreach and information about how to get involved. 

## Accessibility
In building the site, the Code for the Carolinas team worked to ensure accessibility through a variety of means. We have checked that the site operates on multiple platforms and devices. We've also made use of the free, open source, Axe accessibility checker https://www.deque.com/axe/ to make sure the site is easy to operate for all users.
